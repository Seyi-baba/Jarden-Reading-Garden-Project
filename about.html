dwindling reading culture among the youths in our society, we provide our space free for book

Jarding is opening its doors to interns/volunteers who are on outreach as a platform for ministry.
It is an opportunity to serve the host community through seminars and workshops to share and

impact the creative industry of your host community, being part of our internship program as a
short term resource person to share your knowledge, book donations to the library, book reviews
of your book or any community responsibility you deem fit.
